## 🔷 T-Index (Cosmic Structure Indicator)

The **T-Index** quantifies *structural anisotropy* within noisy or simulated cosmic fields.  
It operates by comparing directional correlations and measuring how structural information  
varies between different geometric directions.

This makes the T-Index particularly useful in scenarios where a field contains  
weak or hidden directional patterns that typical statistical tools fail to detect.

## 🔶 PCME (Prime–Composite Matching Energy)

The **PCME model**, developed as part of this framework, introduces a new approach  
to numerical structural detection by leveraging number-theoretic geometry.

PCME combines:

- **K-radius spherical geometry**
- **Prime number masks**
- **Composite number masks**
- **Shell-based matching energy evaluation**

The resulting metric measures the **energy symmetry** between prime-indexed and  
composite-indexed shells, revealing fine-grained structure that is not accessible  
through standard correlation-based indicators.

PCME is especially powerful for:

- detecting faint embedded patterns,  
- analyzing irregular boundaries,  
- and revealing deep structural symmetry in simulated universes.
