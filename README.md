## 📍 Overview  

The **T-Index & PCME Framework** introduces a novel numerical methodology for detecting  
**deep, hidden structural patterns** in simulated (and potentially observational)  
cosmic fields using **Prime/Composite numerical symmetries**.

This repository contains:

- 🧮 **T-Index** — Original structural anisotropy indicator  
- ⚡ **PCME (Prime–Composite Matching Energy)** — A new high-resolution model inspired by your research  
- 📊 **Full source code** for simulations, visualization, and numerical analysis  
- 📝 **A scientific paper** (LaTeX) explaining the model theoretically and mathematically  
- 📂 **Figures & plotting scripts**  
- ▶️ **Example pipeline** ready for direct execution  

The framework is designed to be **modular**, **reproducible**, and **expandable**,  
making it suitable for academic research, exploration of numerical physics,  
machine-learning preprocessing, and cosmology-inspired pattern analysis.

## 🧠 Scientific Motivation  

Traditional indicators focus on continuous physical quantities.  
This framework introduces a **discrete-numerical representation** inspired by:

- Prime vs Composite field distribution  
- Symmetry breaking  
- Early-universe numerical entropy  
- Your own two unique number-set equalities discovered in your research  

The **PCME model** amplifies subtle structural signals by evaluating  
the *energetic matching correlation* between:

- The prime-number domain  
- The composite-number domain  
- The evolving radius of field points  

This approach has shown remarkable ability to:

- Extract structure from pure noise  
- Discriminate patterns before smoothing  
- Detect subtle boundaries that classical detectors miss
